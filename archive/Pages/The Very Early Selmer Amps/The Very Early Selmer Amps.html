<hr width="50%" align="CENTER"><br><h2><center>THE STORY OF SELMER AMPLIFIERS - PART 1</center></h2><font size="4"><br></font>
<font size="5" class="auto-style2"><strong>Selmer took over the R.S.Amplifiers Ltd company in December 1947, and began marketing a range of PA equipment, closely followed by combo amps dedicated to single instruments such as the piano accordion and that new upstart....the electric guitar! In fact, Selmer had been producing amplifiers under their own brand name from 1935 onwards at
Charing Cross Lane, London. RSA were based initially at Reynolds Road, Acton Lane, London W4, and it would appear that their product name was "Truvoice". All production was very soon consolidated at
Charing Cross Road, and the Selmer-Truvoice story had begun!<br><br>There is very little information apparently available on these formative years, and very few amplifiers from this era seem to have survived. We have however been contacted by some owners of these rare pieces through this website, and hence are able to feature the following units. 
</strong> </font>
<p><font size="5" class="auto-style2"><strong>As an aside, an interesting piece of evidence which demonstrates the roots of
Selmer's electronics part of the business existed in the catalogues up to the
late 1960's. This was a </strong> <u><a href="http://www.vintagehofner.co.uk/selmer/early/cat98.jpeg"><strong>Contact Microphone</strong></a></u><strong>, which still had the name RSA
Truvoice on its casing right up to that time. Presumably, Selmer didn't want to
go to the expense of changing the case mould.&nbsp;</strong></font></p>
<p><font class="auto-style2" size="5"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>
IMPORTANT - During this early period, Selmer Truvoice did not fit mains 
transformers to their amps, resulting in an inherent safety problem if one's amp 
has not been modified to prevent possible electrocution. It is strongly 
recommended that any owner of one of these amps checks out this</strong></span>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDlLZuxIB-E" target="_blank"><strong>YOU TUBE VIDEO</strong></a>
<span class="auto-style3"><strong>produced by Nick Adams which very effectively 
describes the problem in detail and advises on the best way of isolating oneself 
from the mains current when using such an amp.</strong></span><strong><br class="auto-style3">

<h3>THE SELMER-TRUVOICE MODEL "15" COMBINATION AMPLIFIER</h3>
<p><font size="4">Probably a 10 watt combo, and fitted with a 12" speaker.
A single volume control and tone control located in a recess on top of the amp.
Five unknown valves were fitted to this amp which seems to have been introduced
by Selmer very soon after World War 2.<br><br></font></p>

<h3>THE SELMER-TRUVOICE TV10 COMBINATION AMPLIFIER</h3>
<p><font size="4">A mid-range model that was based on a 10" speaker. Two input sockets for high and low impedance, each with their own volume
control, and a shared tone control. A rather prominent voltage selector which
also serves as the on-off switch for the amp! Valves: 1 x ECC83; 1 x 12AX7; 2 x
EL84 (?) giving a rated output of 8 watts (peak 10 watts).</font></p>

<h3>THE SELMER-TRUVOICE TV15 COMBINATION AMPLIFIER</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<font size="4">Three inputs (two high and one low impedance), with a volume control
for each input and a single shared tone control. The same type of voltage
selector/on-off switch as for the TV10 above. Curious strip-type art deco
speaker grill. The valves originally fitted to these amps were 3 x 12AX7; 2 x PL82; 1 x
PY82 rectifier, although it can be seen from some of the examples below that
these have often been changed over the years. Speaker -

<h3>THE SELMER-TRUVOICE TU8 PA AMPLIFIER &amp; SPEAKER SYSTEM</h3>
<p><font size="4">A PA system that was designed for portability. The amplifier section was
stored inside the two speaker cabinets, which themselves clipped together to
make one compact unit for transportation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h3>THE SELMER-TRUVOICE U12 PA AMPLIFIER &amp; SPEAKER SYSTEM</h3>
<p><font size="4">This model is thought to have been used by the Beatles in their very early
Quarryman days. It was still in the Selmer catalogue in 1958. The amplifier section was
carried inside the two speaker cabinets, which clipped together for easy
portability. Output 12 watts. A microphone was also included in he package.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Over the years there seems to have been a two input version ( Valves - 3 x
KTZ63; 2 x KT33C; 2 x U31) and a three input version ( Valves - 3 x 12AX7; 2 x PL82; 1 x PY82
