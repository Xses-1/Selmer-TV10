Hi here we have my amazing 1950s Selmer Truvoice 15 Combo Amplifier


This is a very rare amplifier with the original speaker in remarkable condition which is very valuable in its own right


It’s in remarkable condition considering it’s 70 years old see pics it’s stunning

I have just spent £280 having it completely overhauled by a valve amp specialist and it’s looking sounding great and most importantly has been made safe to use,

These amplifiers rectified DC directly from the mains which meant simple component failure could make the chassis or sockets live

I have had an isolation transformer fitted to make it safe

Here is a breakdown of what work has been done .....

Replace all capacitors of all types except two remaining on output transformer which seem good. Replace other parts as required (a few resistors, most tested good when removed from circuit). Sprague 'orange drop' caps used in all signal path positions; good quality modern electrlytics in power supply and bypass positions.


Remake power supply and earth system, installing isolation transformer internally and IEC input flush to back panel to modern safety standards and full chassis earth, with as little invasion to cab, back panel and chassis as possible. System adapted to tie earth bus to chassis and chassis to mains supply earth.

Matched pair new old stock KT33 output valves

The work is also guaranteed for one year ( you will need to get it to Axminster Devon and back to have it repaired )

the amp sounds amazing , breaks up lovely pure class
