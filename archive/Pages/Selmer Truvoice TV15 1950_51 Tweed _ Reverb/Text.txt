Henri Selmer RSA Truvoice Model TV15 Early 1950’s Serial Number: 15/279

This is an incredibly rare amp – from the first range of Selmer Guitar amps and Selmer’s version of an early Fender Tweed Deluxe amp. Striped tweed covering with 12 inch Goodmans Audiom 60 speaker. Amp set in base. Bakelite handle – original type but looks like another handle has been on at some time. Amp is all original as far as  I can tell with the exception of being recapped  by John Chambers the UK’s leading expert on vintage valve amp repairs – see photos. Uses KT32 Output Tubes. Same DC Design as the TV10 with the same requirements to use with an isolating transformer in the UK. Some staining and patching on the tweed but excellent condition for its age. This is the actual amp shown on the Vintage  Hofner Website as owned by Ian McNeill of Edinburgh and is the earliest known example of a TV15 in circulation in the UK. I have only ever seen two others.
