# Selmer-TV10
All the historical data and documentation about Selmer model TV10 and creation of its replica.


This repository contains all the pictures and data that I found on the internet about Selmer TV10 PA amp. I used this to recreate a replica of the amp as seen in the pictures folder.


I am uncertain about the original schematic because it was never published anywhere. To reconstruct it I used the one for TV15 and adjusted it accordingly to the components used. I was able to acquire the original Selenium rectifier and I found its refrence design, so I also used that. The one very important component that was actually a starting point for the entire project is the original NOS Rola speaker, and as seen in the pictures of the original amplifiers, this is the correct speaker for this device.


I also made a few modifications to improve safety, sound (especially when overdriven), and general usebility of the device in the modern era. Modifications included:
- adding power supply transformer (lol)
- only one input transformer - I used a transformer from a passive DBox, so it has a decent frequency response; the other input is just straight in; originally it was through a microphone transformer, but this doesn't make sense nowadays
- replacing 6AQ5's with 6V6GT's (actually 6P6S's because Eastern Europe)
- adding 1/4 attenuator to extend the lifespan of the speaker
- adding speaker jack connector, so the device can be used with external speakers
- adding master volume knob
- adding a grid stopper for the Cathodyne stage
- adding a Fender style cap on one of the input volume potentiometers, so the sound is more bright
- adding heather balance potentiometer, because I have power trafo now



The end result:
